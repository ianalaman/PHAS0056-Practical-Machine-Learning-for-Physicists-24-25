    "- The error for **m1 (blue)** remains relatively low compared to **m2 (orange)**, which exhibits a steeper increase.  \n",
    "- The **combined error (green)** follows an upward trend, indicating a general loss of accuracy over time.  \n",
    "- Unlike the previous analysis, error accumulation is more pronounced for **m2**, suggesting that the new initial conditions result in greater instability in the second mass.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Prediction Loss (Bottom Plot)**  \n",
    "- The overall loss increases steadily as extrapolation time increases, reaching its peak near **t0 + 80dt to 90dt**.  \n",
    "- There is a slight decline at **t0 + 100dt**, but the loss remains significantly higher than at shorter time steps.  \n",

    "- Training the model with a **wider range of initial conditions** could help improve robustness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steady Increase in Loss**  \n",
    "- The continuous rise in loss indicates that **long-term dependencies are not well captured** by the LSTM model.  \n",
    "- Using **attention mechanisms or recurrent dropout** might help prevent performance degradation over time.  \n",

    "3. **Test the Model’s Extrapolation Ability**  \n",
    "   - Assess how far into the future the model can predict before errors accumulate.  \n",
    "   - Compare the **prediction error** and **training loss** against previous experiments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluate Generalization Across Initial Conditions**  \n",

    "- **Initial Condition 1 (Blue Line)**  \n",
    "  - The loss remains very low throughout all extrapolation steps.  \n",
    "  - The small fluctuations suggest **slight variations in learning performance**, but the model remains stable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Condition 2 (Red Line)**  \n",
    "  - The loss is **consistently higher**, following a pattern similar to the error plot.  \n",
    "  - The loss increases steadily with extrapolation time, confirming that the model struggles with **long-term accuracy** in this case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Insights**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Stability Varies with Initial Conditions**  \n",
    "   - The model performs **significantly better** for **Initial Condition 1** compared to **Initial Condition 2**.  \n",
    "   - This suggests that certain initial conditions **lead to more predictable trajectories**, while others introduce greater complexity and instability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error and Loss Growth in Complex Cases**  \n",
    "   - The steady increase in error and loss for **Initial Condition 2** suggests that **m2's trajectory is more chaotic** in this setting.  \n",
    "   - The LSTM struggles with **long-term dependencies**, leading to **compounded errors over time**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Potential Overfitting to Certain Trajectories**  \n",
    "   - The model may have **learned periodic behaviors** in Initial Condition 1, leading to **low error and loss** for that case.  \n",
    "   - However, it **fails to generalize** well for Initial Condition 2, where predictions degrade faster.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Final Conclusion**  \n",
    "- The LSTM model effectively predicts **short-term** trajectories but struggles with **long-term stability**, especially for more chaotic initial conditions.  \n",
    "- The model's accuracy **depends on the chosen initial conditions**, suggesting that training on a **wider variety of cases** could improve generalization.  \n",
    "- **Future Improvements:**\n",
    "  - Use **sequence-to-sequence architectures** to improve long-term stability.  \n",
    "  - Introduce **attention mechanisms** to focus on important patterns.  \n",
    "  - Train with **a larger dataset including more diverse initial conditions**.  \n",
    "  - Apply **physics-based constraints** to enforce physically valid predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the model works well in specific scenarios, it requires **further refinement** to handle complex dynamics over extended time horizons.  \n"
